What Is My Purpose?

A. To find out the people and thier flying patterns in order to market the airline buisness.

How Did I Do This?

A. I have gathered the airline passangers flying data online. After converting the the data to pandas dataframe. I have noticed the data is not being in a single scale. so i have normalized the data. I have checked the basic EDA process and whether the data is following Normal distribution or not, which is the basic thing to check, to make sure there is no multi collinearity problem. Aftre making sure, I have applied the AgglomerativeClustering function to find out how the homogenous data has been divided into clusters.
